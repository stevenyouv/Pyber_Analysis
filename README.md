# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis:

Purpose
1.  Create a summary DataFrame of PyBer's  ride-sharing data by city type utilizing Python and Pandas
2.  Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type utilizing Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Results:

The PyBer Summary DataFrame created displays Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver based on the type of city - Rural, Suburban, or Urban.  

Based on the data gathered in the DataFrame, Urban cities had far more total rides, total drivers, and total fares than Suburban and Rural cities with Rural cities being the lowest in the the mentioned indices.  Rural cities, however had a higher Average Fare per Ride and higher Average Fare per Driver whereas Urban cities had the lowest. 

The multi-line graph showing Total Fare by City Type clearly illustrates that Urban Cities are by far the biggest overall revenue drivers while Rural cities produce the least amount of revenue, and the three type of cities show similar peaks and dips between the months of January and April.  

## Summary

The recommendation would be to maintain the amount of drivers in Urban areas, but consider increasing the fares to maximize revenue and increase profit.  While increasing fares, monitor the impact on number of rides to see if it causes a negative trend.

The recommendation for both Suburban and Rural areas would be to increase the amount of drivers and consider lowering the fares.  While this may decrease overall average fare per ride and driver, it can also increase the amount of rides and overall revenue.  This would also need to be monitored to determine if the lack of riders in these areas is due to price, the amount of drivers, or just a lack of customers in these areas.
